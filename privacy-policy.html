      </div>
      <div>
        <h1 class="mt-10 mb-4 text-3xl font-extrabold">Information We Collect</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">We collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us; when we passively collect information from you, such as from your browser or device; and from third parties.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold">Information You Provide Directly to Us</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">We will collect any information you provide to us. We may collect information from you in a variety of ways, such as when you: (a) create an online account, (b) make a donation or purchase, (c) contact us or provide feedback, (d) subscribe to our newsletter, (e) visit our web pages, or (f) install and/or use our Products/Services. This information may include but is not limited to your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, payment information and your geographic location.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold">Information that Is Automatically Collected</h2>
        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-1xl font-extrabold">Device/Usage Information</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices or tablets) you use to access the Products/Services. As described further below, we may collect and analyze (a) device information such as IP addresses, location information (by country and city), unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, browser types, browser language, operating system, mobile device carrier information, and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Products/Services, such as referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, statistical information about the use of the Products/Services, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Products/Services, the frequency of your use of the Products/Services, error logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-1xl font-extrabold">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">We also collect data about your use of the Products/Services through the use of Internet server logs and online tracking technologies, like cookies and/or tracking pixels. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to: (a) recognize your computer; (b) store your preferences and settings; (c) understand the web pages of the Products/Services you have visited and the referral sites that have led you to our Products/Services; (d) enhance your user experience by delivering content  specific to your inferred interests; (e) perform searches and analytics; and (f) assist with security administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Products/Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. We may also use tracking technologies in our license buttons and/or icons that you can embed on other sites/services to track the website addresses where they are embedded, gauge user interaction with them, and determine the number of unique viewers of them. If you receive email from us (such as the CC newsletter, campaign updates, or other ongoing email communications from CC), we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as whether you open our message, click on any links or banners our email contains, or otherwise interact with what we send. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Products/Services.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold">Information from Third Parties</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">To the extent permitted by law, we may also collect information from third parties, including public sources, social media platforms, and marketing and market research firms. Depending on the source, this information collected from third parties could include name, contact information, demographic information, information about an individual’s employer, information to verify identity or trustworthiness, and information for other fraud or safety protection purposes.</p>
